## Project Title

Analysis of CTA L-Ridership, O'Hare, Midway Airport Flights/Passenger Volumes, Population trend in Chicago Community Areas which include O'Hare, and Midway Airports.

## Description

In Chicago, the CTA Blue and Orange L-lines allow travelers to go to O'Hare Airport and Midway Airport respectively. The other two means of transport to get to O'Hare and Midway from the city are taxi rides and transportation network providers(TNP such as Uber, Lyft, etc.) rides respectively.

In this project, we will use the CTA Blue and Orange Line ridership data from years, 2014 to 2019, and the taxi and tnp ridership data to understand utilization and depict patterns. We will write a python code to run commands and compute 
statistics using pandas to answer the following questions:
##### Total CTA L-ridership trend from 2014 to 2019 for O’Hare and Midway Airports
##### Percent difference in ridership between 2016 and 2019
##### Population near the community areas around O’Hare and Midway airports
##### Ridership for O’Hare and Midway Airport for 2019 by month.
##### The trend in taxi and Transportation Network Ridership(TNP) rides for drop off and pick up at O’Hare and Midway Airports for 2019 by month
